# Polish Subtitles Fixer

This project, coded in react with TypeScript is changing encoded characters in a subtitles file to it's polish counterparts.

## Features
1. DropBox
2. Possibility of upload then download updated file
3. Some simple animations

## Appearance
The design was done in 30 minutes so it is not amazing and there could be more indicators for user, but I think the project is really flexible and most of visual aspects can be changed without breaking the code.

## Problems
To prevent some bugs the component will force self render
